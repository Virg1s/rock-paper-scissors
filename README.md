Rules can be modified in .app/controllers/throw_controller.rb.
The instructions for modifications are contained in the file.

P.S. I did not manage to get the rspec gem to work properly
(certainly did not think that setting up rspec would the the hard part)
so sadly there will be no tests :'(

P.P.S Decided to try doing this task using VIM so there may be some minor
whitespace/linting issues since IDE wasn't there to hold my hand
